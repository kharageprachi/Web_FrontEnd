<li>In 1595, a Maratha chief named Maloji Bhosale, the grandfather of Shivaji Bhosale, was enobled by the Ahmadnagar Sultan, Bahadur Nizam Shah and he gave him Shivneri and Chakan.</li><br>
<li>Shivaji was born at the fort on 19 February 1630 (some accounts place it 1627), and spent his childhood there.</li><br>
<li>Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to goddess Shivai Devi,after whom Shivaji was named.</li><br>
<li>The English traveller Fraze visited the fort in 1673 and found it invincible.</li><br>
