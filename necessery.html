Forts have been important in the history of mankind. Great warrior kings spent their riches, 
and energy in building forts, be it the Romans, be it
the Pathans, be it the Marathas, the warriors built forts. Conventionally forts were built to ensure a safe and secure human settlement, to keep the enemy far away and to ensure having an upper hand during war. Do you know that the oldest fort in the world is in India? Its name is Kangra Fort and there is Goddess Vajreshwari temple in the fort; you will get to visit it during road journey from Dharamshala to Jammu.<br><br>

India has a wide and large history, it is said there might be some more forts which are not yet discovered by anyone. As of now, India has approximately more than 1000 forts. It‟s worth to note that Shivaji Maharaj gave immense importance to forts and literally built 111 forts within 35 years! He built forts for three prime reasons: first is to establish the empire in the region, to sustain it and expand it. Second reason is once a fort was built in a region, it influenced the lives of the locals residing up to a radius of 50 km from the fort; every fort filled the posts of Killedar (the one with the keys of the fort), Chowkidars (guards), Metkaris (for maintaining intelligence vigil), etc. The locals were benefited by employment generation, markets grew and a sense of security prevailed.The third reasons is these helped in earning loyalty of that region towards Shivaji Maharaj, and the youth would join his army and help him conquer more and more states.
